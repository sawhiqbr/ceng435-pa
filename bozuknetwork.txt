our report should include plots and figures that show the impact of file transfer with TCP
and UDP, over at least 30 runs per experiment. It should also include 95% confidence interval and
mean. You have to write a report that analyzes the figures and draws conclusions

You will analyze the impact of delay, packet loss percentage, corrupt packet percentage, 
duplicate percentage, reorder percentage on the total time to download all 20 objects. 
You will plot figures for each parameter (delay, loss, ...) where the x-axis of the 
figure will have various values for these parameters and the y-axis will be the total 
time to download 20 objects. There will be two curves in each figure, one for TCP and 
the other curve for your UDP-based RDT implementation together with interleaving technique.
